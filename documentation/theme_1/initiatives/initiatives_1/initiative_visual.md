## Test plan
Visual management techniques like Kanban boards are usually tested through observation and inspection. There are several ways to ensure that Kanban boards are being used effectively and efficiently:

Observation: The best way to test the use of Kanban boards is to observe how they are being used in real-time. Project managers can watch how team members use Kanban boards to manage their work and ensure that they are following the established process.

Regular Reviews: Regular reviews of the Kanban board with the team can help ensure that the board is being used correctly. This can be done during daily stand-up meetings or in a separate review session.

Metrics: Metrics such as lead time, cycle time, and throughput can be tracked to ensure that the Kanban board is improving the flow of work. If the metrics are not improving, it may be an indication that the Kanban board is not being used correctly.

Training: Providing training to team members on how to use Kanban boards effectively can ensure that everyone is using them correctly. This can also help to identify any issues or gaps in the current process.

Feedback: Gathering feedback from team members about the effectiveness of the Kanban board can help identify any issues or areas for improvement. This can be done through regular retrospectives or informal feedback sessions.

Overall, regular observation, reviews, and tracking of metrics can help ensure that Kanban boards are being used effectively. Providing training and gathering feedback can also help identify any issues or areas for improvement.
