# Initiative: Visual management system
## Description
Agile and lean project management both use visual management techniques, such as Kanban boards, to provide a clear and transparent view of project progress. This initiative helps to keep everyone on the same page and focused on the project goals.

## Test plan
Visual management techniques like Kanban boards are usually tested through observation and inspection. There are several ways to ensure that Kanban boards are being used effectively and efficiently:

Observation: The best way to test the use of Kanban boards is to observe how they are being used in real-time. Project managers can watch how team members use Kanban boards to manage their work and ensure that they are following the established process.

Regular Reviews: Regular reviews of the Kanban board with the team can help ensure that the board is being used correctly. This can be done during daily stand-up meetings or in a separate review session.

Metrics: Metrics such as lead time, cycle time, and throughput can be tracked to ensure that the Kanban board is improving the flow of work. If the metrics are not improving, it may be an indication that the Kanban board is not being used correctly.

Training: Providing training to team members on how to use Kanban boards effectively can ensure that everyone is using them correctly. This can also help to identify any issues or gaps in the current process.

Feedback: Gathering feedback from team members about the effectiveness of the Kanban board can help identify any issues or areas for improvement. This can be done through regular retrospectives or informal feedback sessions.

Overall, regular observation, reviews, and tracking of metrics can help ensure that Kanban boards are being used effectively. Providing training and gathering feedback can also help identify any issues or areas for improvement.

Goals: 
Improve Communication: Visual Management techniques help to make project information visible and transparent, enabling effective communication among team members, stakeholders, and customers.

Increase Transparency: Visual Management provides a clear view of project progress, status, and obstacles, which makes it easier to identify problems, and facilitates early intervention.

Enhance Collaboration: Visual Management tools and techniques promote collaboration among team members, which can improve the quality of the project deliverables, and help the team to work together more effectively.

Scope: 
The scope of Visual Management in Agile and Lean project management is to create a visual framework that enhances communication, transparency, collaboration, and efficiency, while promoting a culture of continuous improvement and accountability.

Outcomes: A more organized way to manage workload amongst team memebers

Deliverables: A system of how to organize work amongst team members.

Milestones: Should be determined when team is developed.
